  <h1>Take a Walk on the Wild Side of Cozumel</h1>
  <p>The island of Cozumel seems to have two distinct sides: The western side is where the cruise ships dock, the ferry from Playa del Carmen pulls in, and the beaches are populated with all-inclusive resorts. On the eastern side, the island is undeveloped and wild. Let’s take a walk on the wild side.</p>

  <p>So, the island has very little to see in the middle, and few roads to get there anyway. For history lovers, there are Mayan ruins to explore in the central forest but finding them is difficult. One option is the San Gervasio site, which is a pre-Columbian settlement dedicated to the fertility goddess, Ixchel. To the Mayans, this was sacred ground. You’ll find buildings from 600 AD, including a residence decorated with palm prints of tiny hands, and a temple called the Tall House that has small faces carved in the stone foundation. There are guides at this site, and it is one of the few that is open to the public.</p>
